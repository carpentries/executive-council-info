# Executive Council Yearly Summaries

These documents include a list of the Executive Council Members (and officers) for each year, as well as a summary of the major activities accomplished by each Executive Council.

"Elected" references Community-elected members, while "Appointed" refers to Council-elected members. The dates in each document reference only the current term in which the member is serving (some individuals serve multiple terms).
