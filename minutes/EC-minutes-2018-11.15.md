### **Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting November 15, 2018**

**090/18 Elections**

* How many nominations do we have?

    * There are no recommendations so far for EC-elected positions

* We should start working personal channels to get more self nominations

* Kate needs to send email to Discuss

* We discussed how we could engage the African community

* In the past we’ve had a list of people we personally invited

* There’s usually a bunch that go in the day before deadline

* Can we do something systematic?   Deadline is Nov 26, so we have just over a week.

* Look at list of people who ran last time as well.

* We’re creating a list of people for us to contact and invite and assigning Executive Councilmembers to contact them.  Going after strategic locations and groups.

* Executive Council voting:  Dec 20 is the next meeting scheduled after the election.  Can we move it so we have more time?  Will Dec 13 work for us?  Would be nice to announce everything at once.  Dec 13 confirmed, Kate will be moving it.  

* Can staff contact people as well?  Sure, if they’ve had more contact with that person.

* Kate is still working on election policy.

* Lex:  Executive Council nominated, anyone there yet? We need to do it ourselves.  We also need to brainstorm more people.  Maybe we can ask those who would be good but have no time if they could recommend people.  

* In the notes from a previous meeting, there were some names as well.  We should migrate those into this list as well. This meeting also has the list of experience/qualities that we are looking for, which has also been put it in the blog post.

* Tracy can draft a template email for these feeler conversations with these people.

* We need to schedule the community calls, Erin or Maneesha would be the two maybe to handle it. Kate needs to email them.

**091/19 Code of Conduct task force**

    - Tracy sent out a message about the Code of Conduct.

* Tracy:  Kari has put together a task force idea and a draft of how it would work. Small team for revisions to talk to the relevant people, make changes, put in a Pull Request (PR) against the existing Code of Conduct, leave it open to be an Request For Comments (RFC) for comments and get community comments.  

* Just for the enforcement and reporting guidelines, not for the Code of Conduct itself (which is good to go).

* What is the feedback?  

    * PR framework is a good idea to get more direct comments about it.

    * Rust community has an RFC community.  This might be a good model as well.

    * Would commenting on a PR be intimidating to github novices?  Maybe we could have it as a google doc?  We need to brainstorm.  Issues might also be too much.  

    * We don’t want to hold this up, so let’s maybe try this out with a PR?  Should we do both a PR and a google doc?  Tracy will be adding a note about this in the task force and they will decide.

    * We will need more people for the task force, need to recruit. Will be in touch about getting people.

**092/18 Need a plan for the vision.**

* Karen: been on her todo list.  The mission statement was an easier win and had more consensus.  But the vision statement had more critical thought so we proceeded with the others with plan to revisit.  Now is the time for the vision to proceed.

* How do we move forward on the creative work to remake this vision to fit the community’s feedback and needs?  

* Ethan: volunteering to put back together the original team and to schedule stuff.  

* Can we have something to vote on for our next meeting?

* Maybe? They’ll know once they meet.  But do we need to go back to the community?  There seemed to be no consensus, other than rejection of the vision statement proposed.

* What do we think of going back to the community, because it might also help engage them with the voting process.

**093/18 Hiring:**

* Two offers, one has accepted.  Talisha will be the business admin role.  Starts tomorrow!

* Will ask Talisha to join us for the next Executive Councilmeeting.

**094/18 Need to approve the minutes**

* please do the thing
