**Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting October 18, 2018**

**080/18 Approve minutes September and October**

Folks to review the minutes during next week. Lex will merge when have >= 4 thumbs ups.

**081/18 Review blog post for elections policy**

A lot of things need to be coordinated with staff. We are asking self nomination for elected seats and indications for the appointed seats. We are running against the clock. We need to plan some community calls for the election. Community calls need to be reviewed. After the election, all of us need to vote for the appointed seats and have the confirmation from appointed members. Doable but tight. We need to be clear about that this is not how we envision this. And we can ask people nominated for appointed seats if they are interested. The Google form also has a field asking if the person is aware of that.

Doing a transition during holidays is hard and takes longer than normal. Should we move the time to February? This would involve extending our terms one month. Some people in Software Carpentry board were against. Would like to vote on this. We move the new terms so that we comply with the bylaws. We solidify election results in December and new terms starts in February. The other option was to move the election to November but we don't have time.

We might need to have the list of people that could say "yes" to be Executive Council member a little earlier in future years. Vote to move the beginning of new terms from 1st January to 1st February. That will be written into the bylaws.

MOTION: The 2019 Executive Council will begin their term of office on February 1, 2019, and all subsequent transitions of governance will occur on February 1 thereafter.

Motion put forward by Kate Hertweck. Seconded by Ethan White.

Motion approved 8 with votes.

Anyone, even from outside the community, can nominate people to appointed seats. The reason is that we are trying to identify the best people to help the organization, and some of them may be people outside of our close circles.

**082/18  Review bylaws RFC (Kate) - what is the status and when will we be ready to vote?**

Kate will be merging branches to resolve the issues and the discussions on the bylaws.

**083/18  Review Lesson Program Policy and plan approval process**

Lesson Program Policy is receiving comments from staff and Executive Council. Library Carpentry is pushing to have this policy ready. Language is important and we need to unify the use of words that are synonymous. We had the distinction between policy and roadmap. Which one needs a vote from the Executive Council? Policy and roadmap should be two different documents. The latter is to help people that want to be lesson programme.

**Action point**: Tracy is going to clarifyclear a bit of the language and email Executive Council for comments on the document.

**084/18 Timeline for process and vote on Library Carpentry?**

What would be the next step for welcoming a new lesson programme? Library Carpentry is waiting for it. Maybe we need to deal with Library Carpentry as it is at the moment and write things for the next lesson programme. Would be nice to have some external review. It will take some extra time. Given how far into the process Library Carpentry is, adding external review now doesnâ€™t seem desirable.

The goal is to accept Library Carpentry before the end of the year. They agreed with everything except the lesson release,  which we agreed to push to 2019.

We can't vote on adding Library Carpentry before we vote on the policy and roadmap. End of the year sounds reasonable.

**Action point**: Executive Council to vote on the policy at the next meeting. Invite Library Carpentry to reply to questions
