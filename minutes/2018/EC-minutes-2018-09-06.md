### Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting Sep 6, 2018

**059/18 Vision**

* Feedback from community: current draft not aspirational enough and needs to be forward thinking

* Does vision say what we want the world to look like or how we do it?

* One perspective: Mission is about who you are. It answers the questions "What is our purpose?" and “Why do we exist?” Some people prefer to use the term Purpose, as there is less confusion about what it means, but essentially mission and purpose are synonyms and mean the same thing.

* One definition: Mission is your purpose or reason for existence, while vision is about the possibilities of what you can become. It encompasses purpose, but is broader. Vision provides a clear picture or mental image of the ideal end-state. 

* Vision should be unachievable

* Is the vision a global community teaching skills, or that everyone has these skills (or both?)

* Suggestion: Inclusive data and computing training available to everyone

* Should vision only include everyone having the skills (i.e. could we just hire instructors and send them around to teach and that would reach our vision)

* Need to take community input into account, even if we feel differently

* Put back to community: we want to include these elements, here are some other ideas? (general agreement)

    * **Action item**: Karen to reformat and send out

**060/18 Lesson roadmap**

* Working on lesson program policy - what does Lesson Program and what does Carpentries provide?

* Roadmap - how is this implemented? Does task force bring it to the Executive Council for vote?

    * This one policy that strongly impacts strategic planning, so thus under Executive Council

    * Asynchronous vote?

    * Tangent: Should think of this as precedent-setting (Executive Council voting on policy); this one could be declared special; may want to decide in advance for future task forces; Have mandates for task forces

**061/18 Clarity for how we talk about Library Carpentry**

* Executive Director would like to have language about Library Carpentry when talking about the carpentries so that we come across as welcoming to Library Carpentry

* Like incubating; see [https://incubator.apache.org/](https://incubator.apache.org/) for a parallel example; general agreement about liking the incubating terminology

* Can we ask that they follow the official procedure we are developing? → Policy not complete; form does not yet exist; feels like making them hoop jump because we already have all of this information from them

* Can we create the form and fill it out for them (and have them approve) (where ‘form’ might be github issue with checkboxes)

**062/18 Mission statement**

* Can we vote on this at the next meeting even if we are still working on the vision statement? → Yes, will put on agenda for next meeting

    * Action point: Karen to provide info in advance of next meeting

**063/18 Review of communication timeline**

* Will we have statement on mission and vision for september (optimistic yes)

* Bylaws post: Request For Comments (RFC) ends on Friday, will not have synthesized and voted by end of September; Lex and Elizabeth will synthesize comments and aim for Executive Council vote by Oct 1 (blog post by week of Oct 8)

**064/18 Task force for election policy**

* previous notes say Karen, Ethan, Tracy, will ask Maneesha

* Kate will put together deadlines for decisions; Maneesha can fill out the rest (what needs to happen by X so that Y happens in time)
