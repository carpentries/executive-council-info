Blog post will go out tomorrow about this.

**087/18 Adoption of Bylaws.**

Lots of recent commits and Pull Requests, but no big changes other than new date for Executive Council turnover based on last meeting discussion.

Code of Conduct now mentioned in individual member section, and includes link to handbook.

Thanks to Tracy for language on membership termination.

Between election vacancies -- do we need a max length of time for this? Current bylaws do indicate that if it happens in October we will lump the replacement in with the normal voting.

Other open issues belong in policies and not the bylaws.

We discussed whether we need to further clarify versions of the code of conduct within the bylaws, but decided that linking to the handbook version of the code of conduct was adequate.

Suggestion that the bylaws, once approved, will live in the handbook. Tracy will take care of getting the Pull Request made for putting the bylaws in the handbook.

Do we need to have the vision in the bylaws to vote? One question of whether the mission and/or vision need to be there. Perhaps just the mission and not the vision, since the mission speaks more to how we operate than the vision does.

Vision has been removed prior to voting.

Motion text: The Carpentries Executive Council moves to formally adopt the bylaws as written

Ethan moved. Elizabeth seconded. Motion passed.

Huge thanks to Kate for shepherding the bylaws through this whole process.

**088/18 Code of Conduct committee review**

This Code of Conduct Committee has recently finished dealing with multiple incident reports. As we continue to grow, the number of reports is likely to increase and we should work with the committee to ensure that the resulting workload is manageable and that individual incidents can be addressed rapidly. The long-term goal is a committee that rapidly addresses incident reports without placing excessive obligations on the volunteers on the committee. The challenge of this balance was acknowledged. Given the importance of this committee the possibility of an annual review was discussed and generally considered a good idea. The possible timing of this review was discussed. Given that the end of the year is a busy time for everyone it was also suggested that informal suggestions from the Executive Council and Executive Director based on their experiences with the recent incidents might be a useful starting point. Code4Lib was identified as a source for insights into scalable Code of Conduct committee processes, including having multiple staff with training to support rapidly addressing straightforward incidents.

**Action point: **Karen will be drafting a letter to the Code of Conduct committee for comments by the Executive Council.

**089/18 Status and plans for Executive Council nomination documentation and process**

Kate is coordinating calls etc.  We should encourage people to run for Executive Council. There is a blog post and Kate will be sending out an email.

Blog post needs to be updated to three council-elected seats.
