### 21/10 - Carpentries Instructor Trainer Committee proposal

The Carpentries Instructor Trainer community proposes to form a governing body based on election amongst its members. This committee will be elected, so, it is different from other committees, e.g. CoC committee, and will have executive power over Instructor Training Programme. The committee will need to work with multiple committees, e.g. curriculum committee. More discussion is needed, such as how to work with EC, what structure works, may require a clearer documentation. There are three options:

1. The EC approves the suggested governance structure as is and lets the Carpentries Instructor Trainer community go ahead with the election
2. The EC lets the Carpentries Instructor Trainer community go ahead with the election but consider their elected committee an interim committee.
3. The EC asks the Carpentries Instructor Trainer community to postpone the election for a few months.   

The EC decided remotely in the follow-up discussion to go for option 2 and that the EC will work together with this elected representation towards a formally established governance body.


## Nonverbal updates:

* The Executive Council (both 2020 and 2021 EC members) is scheduled for a Carpentries community discussion. For details, see the email by Kari  
  * Date: February 22 2021; 15:00 UTC and  22: 00 UTC 
  * We will be sent a set of questions to guide the conversation, and these will be shared with us on Tuesday, February 16
