### 20/19 Assigning 2020 goals
1. Question: How will we roll out the goals and begin to work on them.
2. We should prioritize the goals and there should be two to three people on each item on the goals documents.
    1. Suggested deadline for goals to be assigned by next Executive Council Meeting
    2. The goal is to have new Executive Council members paired with tenured Executive Council members to accomplish these goals.
        1. The ideal is that every goal has an assigned team so that these goals can stay at the top of someone's mind during the year and so that nothing gets lost.
    3. The goal is to work on the drafts one month and then the next month have the team review the drafts.
    4. Core team will be completing their quarterly priorities which will inform our priorities.
    5. Would like to see the new team members jump in to help, even in areas that there is not expertise in.
    6. Voting membership should be added to the by-laws groups.
    7. We should pick a few things that are important to start now so the team can get together this month to start working on things.
    8. Things thats should get started this month are:
            1.  ByLaws, Succession Planning, Strategic Plan, Rubric For Public Statements, Diversifying Revenue
    9. Would like to make the suggestion that by the next Executive Council meeting everyone who signed up for a specific goal should go through the documentation in detail and start with a draft plan for next steps (how long it would take, the amount of work needed and next steps)
    10. The top person for each priority should set up the project document and set up the first meeting for the group.
    11. Lex to set up a folder in drive where all project documents will be stored.
3. Konrad will set up Checklist in Github
4. Kari sent a resource to the group to help with project planning based on what the staff uses. [Project planning template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5gTSFq0KiQmi1qgkYm1hng7i3g71bPody7WkXWTeyU/edit#heading=h.y06zpj6pn0a1)
