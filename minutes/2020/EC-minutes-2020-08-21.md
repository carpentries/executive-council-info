## Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting August 21, 2020

**Present**: This was unfortunately not logged

### 20/42 Approving changes to the bylaws
* Pull request to start the Election procedure in August which will give more time to find adequate members and on-boarding of new members accepted; no conflict with any core team activities; Executive Council member with ending term
* Pull request 2 contains mostly easy fixes with rephrasings but also some details regarding online voting and Executive Director salary level setting  accepted
* Pull request regarding chair limitations to not serve five consecutive years (one should not be chair in the first year and the membership is up to 6 years - a practice not a rule)

### 20/43 Report out from transition/succession planning group
* There is now a Transition planning checklist document (incl. On-boarding for new Executive Director)
* Action item: Review the document (everybody, until September Executive Council Meeting)
* Succession planning should be a deliberate, sustained, and on-going activity - not a one-time effort -- involving both the identification and advancement of individuals within our organization and individuals from outside The Carpentries

### 20/44 Executive Council 2020 project planning progress
* Each project group should review and report its output on a monthly basis; we will revise all projects next Executive Council meeting

### Non-verbal updates

* Remember to review the [Open Action Points](#open-action-points) at the top of this document.
* We still need to approve and publish the minutes of the meetings since February
* CoC worked on their governance document to clarify our roles as committee members; two different chairs are suggested - one for governance and one for incident response
