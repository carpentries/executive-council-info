#### Report on the Online Carpentries Workshops: Project Pilot

Kari Jordan presented the Online Carpentries Workshops: Project Pilot
which started in April 1, 2020 and will take place until September
30, 2020. The goals includes the update of documentation with
recommendations (e.g. handbook, installation instructions, email
templates, websites), upscaling of infrastructure to support online
workshops, training of existing instructors to teach online and to
facilitate pilot workshops. Futhermore, feedback from all community
segments should be collected and the changes be communicated back to
them. A series of blog post will be published for this purpose.  It is
an open experiment: At the end of the pilot we can either decide that
online workshop are something that fits into the Carpentries overall
strategy or not. If the cost structure is the same for online and
offline workshops is an open question.

#### Memberships and strategic grow of the community

There have been questions how to increase the number of instructors in
Latin america - funding for membership is harder to acquire there; As
we are currently shifting to a more online-based mode the instructore
training might become easier/cheaper. There were cases were trainers
volunteered to train instructor but the issue was not settled.

- Action item: Kari will have look at the communication done regarding
  it.
