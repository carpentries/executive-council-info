## Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting February 13, 2020

#### 20/09 Budget overview and Q&A
The goal for budget discussion was to get a context in an update based manner.
a. The main points of the budget is that we have enough money in the bank to cover expenses, core team collaboration was good and we can use the budget to make strategic choices.
b. 2020 Budget Summary General was presented by EWilliams
  i. The Budget was based on the actual values of 2019 to be conservative and produce a realistic estimate. ****ACTION****: EWilliams will track actual values for 2020 alongside this budget. The budget considered the following: 1) Membership income forecasted at 0% - as growth increases it cannot be expected that membership growth will stay the same. 2) Using Foundation income - as only income that is expected in 2020.
  ii. The group discussed a few observations: 1) Most income is spent on core team and staff which is covered on grants. 2) There are high legal fees related to GDPR and taxation in other countries. 3) There will need to be a replacement of office equipment this year. 4) The two sources of income, General vs Grant, should be treated separately, to ensure grant funding is not used for general funding.
  iii. Overall, Quickbooks is being used to better understand what we are spending and ensure we are spending only which is allocated to the specific year.
  iv. **ACTION**: EWilliams will create a new budget to reflect the budget from 2019 to compare to projected actuals of 2020 budget. The group discussed consultant fees and EWilliams clarified they were covered under existing grants. **ACTION**: Juan will create an issue and EC members will asynchronous vote for approval.

#### 20/10 Reassess/reminder of meeting procedures
With incoming new EC members we explained the meeting roles. Highlighting that Timekeeper can play the Gatekeeper role as well, currently The Gatekeeper plays the substitute role. Notekeeper needs to take note of **ACTION** points.

#### 20/11 Q4 CoCc transparency report
Briefly discussed and will proceed to continue working on this.

#### 20/12 Call for any non-staff related 2020 goals for EC
Discuss Ideas, concerns, etc.
Group discussed that the EC can be slow with decisions. It was discussed that the EC should plan to collect discussion topics and prioritize tasks. Currently, there are a few threads open from last year and among the EC, there needs to be a spread of the workload among pairs.
One priority is to work on 2x2 committee meetings with their rubric statements. Group discussed the effect of a new ED and the priorities of the goals. Which will all depend on the skillset of the new ED. **ACTION**: All EC members will read through current issues and prioritize which one they want to work on. This is to be done by the next meeting to discuss and spread the workload. Group discussed looking at a funding model for staff to be part of the strategic plan for other funding streams.
