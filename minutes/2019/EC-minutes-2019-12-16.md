### Minutes Carpentries Executive Council Meeting December 16, 2019 

**19/66 Elections: **



*   Two community elected positions: Lex Nederbragt and Paula Andrea Martinez
*   Already in violation of bylaws because of timing; our vote should have happened by December 15
*   Executive Council voting is supposed to be anonymous, but open to discussing candidates and stating opinions about candidates
*   Discussion of candidates
    *   Would benefit from someone with industry experience 
    *   Some companies might not be positively viewed by community
    *   Have wanted to have candidates with related experience who aren’t deeply embedded in our community already
    *   Connection in Germany would be positive (they are our second biggest market)
*   Everyone will vote for top two candidates, and Kate will send results, and then we can vote on motion for candidates

**19/67 Budget**

*  Planning for formal budget approval in Feb with new Executive Council 
*  The new budget will be circulated in time for discussion at the February meeting.
*  Talking to a company for aid in preparing budget


**19/68 Question about grant funding** - concern about CZI and Zuckerberg name


*   Looked at values and approach of CZI initiative separate from Z name
*   Do we need a blog post about this, or just respond to the email?
*   More generally, would be good to have some documentation about how we vet potential partners, funders (Kari notes that this is happening as part of Sponsorship program)
*   Could have something prepared as a response to question but not a blog post right now

**19/69 Strategic planning!**


*   Sent the Executive Council goals to Team, who added objectives for each goal
*   Probably need one more pass of this doc before voting 
*   Lists under each Goal are too long and too detailed
*   Need more Why and less What - something in the middle between the high level goals and the list of tasks
*   Aim to have another version ready for voting at Jan meeting
*   Amy will do first revision and then pass onto others for review
*   Have version to Team by Dec 30
*   Note that funding page lists almost only North American sources, should diversify
*   Is there any issue with Community Initiative(CI) for bringing in funding from outside? Easier than sending money
*   Search committee for the new Executive Director
*   Karen is chair of search committee
*   Met two weeks ago with consultant, will meet again this week
*   Have let Community Initiative(CI) know that international hire is a possibility (and this seems possible); let Community Initiative(CI) know as soon as possible if we have a short-listed candidate who is outside of the US

**19/70 January meeting** - best time is a week earlier at the same time (Jan 13)

* Scheduling 2020 in-person as soon as possible once we have the new council
