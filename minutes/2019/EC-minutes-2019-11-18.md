### Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting November 18, 2019 

**19/63 Election activities for October**

* 2 community-elected nominees so far, but form is still open
* Kate working with Juan to get the ballot together
* Please remember to email people to encourage them to nominate themselves
* Last year we did a community call with candidates but this was not very well attended. New plan is to provide short videos introducing candidates
* The community will receive an email (discuss and maintainer lists) to make them aware of membership and inviting them to check their voting status (as per the Bylaws)
  * Last year more people contacted us when the ballot went out. Will make a Google form for request for updating status; Kate to review such requests
* All information on elections is in the elections folder on Google Drive

**19/64 Review of our goals and objectives draft**

* We discussed adding something about what we mean with community and making some terms more clear
* Do we need to specify more about the distinction between The Carpentries (umbrella) and the Lesson Programs? This is meant to be addressed by bullet point under item 4, organisational structure. We agreed that we add “These are the Strategic Goals for The Carpentries project. Lesson Programs may have their own strategic goals related to their programs.”
* Instructor training was missing and we feel this was an oversight of our brainstorming process. We discussed extensively whether this should become its own point (number 7) or can naturally can become bullet points under each of the other 6 goals. 7 items may be too many, but instructor training is vital to our mission. **Decision**: Tracy and Kari to suggest a solution
* **Action point**: we consider the document ready to be handed over to Tracy and staff. They will return it to us in time for our next meeting, current plan is December 10th

**19/65 Executive Director search**

* Heidi Hernandez, Vice Person of client services of Community Initiatives (CI) joined us for this item, is a resource for us in the Community Initiatives side
* Recommendations around transitions is to hire a person on board with appropriate experience. Tracy found a person that seems to be a very good fit, called Rachael Gibson, focus on the new person being a cultural fit, see (or rather, listen to) [https://blog.joangarry.com/ep-96-the-telltale-signs-of-founder-syndrome-part-1/](https://blog.joangarry.com/ep-96-the-telltale-signs-of-founder-syndrome-part-1/)
* Heidi: transitioning from a founding Executive Director is a critical stage in a non-profit, Carpentries is fortunate to have the funds to do such a hire and help us design a process that is as light-weight as possible. Community Initiatives offers to have a person on our search committee. Advice for search committee: next Executive Council chair, someone rolling of the Executive Council for historical context, maybe someone brand new; 3 or 4 people would be enough
* Important to make the search process Executive Council-led
* Initial phase: Tracy and Amy start up discussions with consultant, Karen, Elizabeth, Juan and Joslynn also volunteered for the search committee. Heidi is also available
* **Decision**: we support the search committee deciding on bringing on a consultant for this process (within the available budget), deadline: two weeks
* Tracy to draft a blog post for announcing her departure for late this week
