### Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting April 18, 2019**

#### 19/21 Communication via GitHub

- Executive Council Members should watch repositories so we can communicate asynchronously between meetings: [https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed)
- Also use tool to submit items for each meeting: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Im9aI3rpr58eiZvE-xIpsiHKg_rmKdEVFUaRX-WYBX4/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Im9aI3rpr58eiZvE-xIpsiHKg_rmKdEVFUaRX-WYBX4/edit>)
- Sharing info using Google Drive folder for Executive Council members: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ss6oh2vfLc_pE8xk9UpOh9UUwSpDBr2g](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ss6oh2vfLc_pE8xk9UpOh9UUwSpDBr2g)

#### **19/22** [**Plan for Project work**](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/45) **and** [**identifying projects**](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/46)**:** how the staff operates

- Planning for project work: quarterly projects for staff
  - GitHub issue includes plan for how to use task forces to assign individuals, identify specific goals, and implement project
  - Example is Code of Conduct process implementation
  - How to identify community members and otherwise set up task force? This would be the job of the task force leader
  - Task force charter template includes goals, deliverables, and timeline for task force; we need to spend time developing this (but can be based on CoC charter)
  - Process: Executive Council identifies specific project for which task force will be created, Executive Council Member identified as point of contact, charter is created (by staff and/or Executive Council Member), solicits additional members
  - Executive Council will need to approve charter, but this needs to occur in a timely manner, one week comment period would be reasonable
  - Should revisit charter template in six months or a year to make sure it’s meeting needs
  - Potential projects all appear to be items clearly under the purview of the EC; when do we channel them into task forces? Example is sponsorship program, we should capitalize on experience in the community for what works well for these. Not all potential projects are good for community-based task forces, but this model could still work for internal projects
  - Most folks seem to agree that it is a good idea, but we need some more details and a template to assess. We’ll work asynchronously to comment on the template
- Identifying projects
  - We need to identify what the top priority projects are
  - How to vote? Rely on staff perceptions? Tracy and Amy have discussed what they think the top priorities are and they are in general agreement.
  - We need to identify strategic planning needs for a variety of timelines, and continue to track these (perhaps in GitHub repo)

#### 19/23 Communications Officer + communications plan

- We used to have someone identified as a communication point of contact
- We need someone to work with Serah to write blog posts and schedule release, also to communicate updates for newsletter
- Serah is working on communication plan in a broader sense, communication officer will need to add input to this
- Roll communication officer into vice chair position, as the vice chair’s position doesn't have much formally defined, continued responsibility

#### 19/24 Strategic Planning resources

- Group at Stanford that consults on strategic planning: ACT Program [https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/organizations/leverage-gsb/act-nonprofits](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/organizations/leverage-gsb/act-nonprofits)
- Next deadline for application is in July
- Projects typically run for 3-6 months, but can last a year
- We can also consider working with them on the vision statement (see below). 

#### 19/25 Vision plan

- We need to resolve this, but with a different method than last time
- Last time: we drafted initial version, released to community, many comments and disagreements over what the vision statement should be (short or long? What words to use?), next round of feedback from election ballot, again with no clear consensus
- Do we need a vision statement? Some groups have a combined mission/vision, we’ve been operating well without one. However, we may need a vision to help communicate with the community and maintain cohesiveness among our globally distributed members. Everyone talks about The Carpentries differently. This is also important in strategic planning, so we have a general goal for where we’re going. Do we help people become better teachers, or do we teach data and computing skills? 
-  Should we roll this into strategic planning? The vision and strategic plan can work together, even as an internal tool. 
-  Lots of community feedback wanted inspirational vision, maybe this isn't the direction we want to take?
- Theory of change may be a useful perspective, successfully implemented by Software Carpentry: [https://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/](https://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/)  . We could use this as a framework for our vision process

#### 19/26 [Values](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/20) Task Force, [Sponsorship Program](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/48), [Individual Membership](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/47)

- All of these are potential projects (with associated task forces) that are needed
- Values task force is urgently needed, make this a task force project in next quarter to obtain community feedback. Amy volunteered to work on this task force. 
-  Sponsorship program is necessary for financial planning. How do we select sponsors, and what criteria do we use? Program will include soliciting sponsors and method for vetting whether we want to align with them. Raniere and Juan volunteer to work on this task force.
-  Individual membership: we need to identify whether we’d like to change the criteria for individual membership. Karen and Raniere volunteer to work on this.
-  Extra consideration: do we have a description of maturity of programs/communities in different geographic regions? It would be useful to understand this in the context of scalability. This would be useful in continued strategic planning and communication.

**19/27 Items for newsletter:** task forces being planned, some will include community involvement, Q3 (July, August, September) will include values, sponsorship program, and individual membership 

**19/28 Budget:** working with funders and potential funders, still need to communicate with community about this (Tracy and Amy working on this, with Raniere?)

**19/29 DataCamp blog post still forthcoming
