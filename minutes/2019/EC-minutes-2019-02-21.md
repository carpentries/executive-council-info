**19/12  Review in how Executive Council meetings work**

To add something to agenda, contact Chair

Chair will review timing to fit everything in or move to next meeting

Manage meetings by putting up hand “/hand” in chat, facilitator will observe

Reminder that the Code of Conduct applies

Don’t have anything about confidentiality agreement, speak freely at the meetings. Meeting minutes are put in private repo for review before they go public to get approved.

**19/13 Officer roles (in anticipation of election next meeting)**

Need to elect four officers for the next Executive Council meeting

Current Officers: Chair (Karen), vice-chair (Kate), secretary (Lex), treasurer (Raniere); 

Chair position isn't open to new members, folks should think about roles and contact someone in role to get more information.

**19/14  In-person meeting planning**

Discuss Executive Council in-person meeting this year—expenses are paid by The Carpentries. 2018 meeting held in Florida.

Host served as organizer and booked conference rooms.

When can this be held? Sooner is better for this year due to packed schedules.

Last year, official meeting time was a day and a half, hands-on meeting. Some individuals stayed longer but did not make decisions in the extra time. Proposing that we allow more 1.5 days this time. Also, location was decided based on dates.

Karen: First step last year was to pitch location for those willing to host. List location, provide transportation options in the city, logistical details, conference room availability, recommendations to where someone would stay, consider location geographically in the middle for international travelers. Further details and options for this were discussed. We agreed to assemble a document with dates that people had available and visa requirements for travel.

**19/15 Regular meetings in light of time changes**

Next meeting scheduled: 3rd Thursday week of March 21

Same time in most places but in North America it will be an hour later (spring forward)

Karen will make the Google calendar event UTC but same time slot

**19/16 EC report for newsletter**

This week will report back about new Executive Council, sorting out logistical issues. In-person meeting is being planned. Goal to report back to newsletter is sharing what we are doing to encourage other members to participate.

Any further additions to consider?

**19/17 Asynchronous communication**

How do we communicate for things that happen between meetings? Normally we make decisions at meeting times but in reality decisions will need to be made in-between. One mechanism is the email list. Other is private github repo - for Executive Council and Tracy

Primary place to talk about things, look at repo and view issues

Create an issue for something to pay attention to in upcoming meeting. If this requires an internal vote, use thumbs up for “yes” thumbs down for “no” and abstain? :-| (?)

example: https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/37

Voting - as an official voting mechanism, this was the motion and this is the voting, no meeting necessary

If there is a motion (known ahead of time) to be discussed at a meeting, using repo provides an attempt to get the language written up and discuss prior to meeting

Public official motion put into repo

Example: [https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council/issues/40](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council/issues/40)

Thumbs up and down to approve minutes, Executive Council individuals vote. Keep your eye on issues and watch for emails. Conversations on issues will occur in repo. 

(in chat) Note: Always asking where stuff is is a totally normal question, so never hesitate to ask.

Tracy's Executive Director relationship with Executive Council: Executive Director reports to Executive Council, which represents the community, and creates a bridge between the staff and the community. Decision(s) will need to be made and then implemented. 

Reminder to new folks to keep a positive sense of community within the Executive Council, building trust and communication.

Karen will create a document to send out everyone for meeting logistics
