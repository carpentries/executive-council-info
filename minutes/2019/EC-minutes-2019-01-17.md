### **Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting January 17th, 2019**

**19/001 Review of Executive Council onboarding document(s)**

* We have documents to provide to new Executive Council members with relevant information


    * Need to develop a list of things to add new folks to and remove old folks from

* We discussed whether we need to restrict access for new Executive Council members to previous detailed minutes

    * Prior Code of Conduct discussions seem like an important thing to consider

    * Confidentiality is important - but we donâ€™t currently have Executive Council confidentiality requirements

        * **Action point** Need to implement confidentiality agreements for Executive Council members

    * Issues with institutional memory - what if the next Executive Council, of two Executive Councils from now needs to know about something confidential we discussed.

* Conclusion: we will, for now, provide full access to all existing documents to each new Executive Council members

**19/002 Expansion south of the equator**

* Margaret Gferer was one of the community service award winners. She sent an email pointing out that this work was not just hers, asking about plans for expanding south

* Some institutions south are not comfortable with Open in light of colonization, or with people from the north coming into their spaces

* Margaret notes gender bias in who stays in / returns to their home countries (women more likely to stay / return after given opportunities elsewhere)

* Do we have plans for translations of our lessons into more languages?

* We have so far been sustaining growth in the global south primarily with volunteers who are starting to wear out

* Need to develop a strategic plan; think about how we can generate revenue from these activities

* The Executive Council did not manage to think much about strategic planning last year, but plan to do this year

* There may be places where the cultural norms or political/legal laws clash with the Carpentries values, we should form a policy on what to do in those situations

* The issues above were raised during a discussion of how The Carpentries can best serve our communities south of the equator, but certainly apply to other areas as well.

**19/003 New Executive Council liaison for Code of Conduct committee**

* With Ethan White stepping down from the Executive Council, we need another member to take over the liaison role towards the Code of Conduct committee

    * We decided to postpone this to the first meeting of the new Council

* The point made us aware of that we should include non-officer roles in our onboarding documents
