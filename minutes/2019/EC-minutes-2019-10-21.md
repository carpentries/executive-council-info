### Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting October 21, 2019 

#### **19/60  Election activities for October**

* see [Election Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qg__La6vsBfw2vEO22ftalIOdnUsvZ1CGldz1Em3zPM/edit) for what needs to be done this month

* Blog post needs to happen this week to meet the time-line requirements for November.  Mostly written at this point, needs some clarification.

* [Draft blog post](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HlTqLSF1zWc41T6v6S7puCREZkBzSpmTKFIB6wqFRQ/edit)

* No nominees yet for council elected position (Tracy put some in). This responsibility is really important for the Executive Council, so it's very important for us to nominate people or encourage current community members to stand for election. Anyone hesitant but interested could be nominated for council elected so we have their info for tracking/encouragement.  

* How do we want to handle the community call for elections. Do we do recordings or a meeting? Worried that requiring a video recording will turn people off.  Current submission process is a web form.  

  * Recordings were really useful for selecting someone for Regional Coordinator. If we require this, we should give people specific talking points to respond to.  
  * Should we do this interview style? Maybe a member of the Executive Council interviews them for the recording. But makes post editing a bit better.
  * General liking of interview style recording rather than community call.

* Kate will update the blog post accordingly, that people can fill out the form to nominate themselves, and then an Executive Council member will be in touch to get the interview recording prepared.

* We need dates set aside for everything. Nominations should close Nov 26, then recordings and such created between then and Dec 3. Election polling is released Dec 3-7. Juan will work with Kate to review the setup process for the election so someone next year will have experience. Mid-December we need to have announcement of final slate. Elizabeth will help with this video coordination.  

* Coordinating other communications around election post.

#### **19/61 Community Awards -- soliciting nominations is on our [calendar](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/blob/master/process/timeline.md) for October**

* Raniere will be taking care of getting this posted later today. Loop Serah in for communications, etc. 


#### **19/62 Check in about the in-person meeting**

*   Check in with people about any needs.
*   Lodging: will be in a hotel nearby. Elizabeth Williams is making reservations and booking lunch reservations.
*   Many people are arriving Friday, do we want to schedule anything for Saturday?  Can they do some pre-work about strategic planning? Yes, several people will be arriving in time to meet up. Suggestion to share time for flights so you can share trains, etc. Also, share contact info for people during travel. Suggesting that we look at the Theory of Change structure. Includes structured questions to discuss and get the conversation on track. Kate will discuss with Amy about getting some Saturday activities organized and coordinated. Concern about having a limited subset of members go so far with the discussions. Will need to balance what is being worked on Saturday so that we aren’t starting blank, but that we haven’t gone ahead and not included all perspectives. Tracy has shared a document to collect ideas. By the afternoon on Saturday we’ll have a plan to go in on Sunday.  This includes grinding through any data collection, evidence gathering, etc. Tracy will follow up with folks not on the call.  
*   Reimbursements: can’t do per diem, so please keep receipts.  
*   Reminder to review non-verbal updates.
