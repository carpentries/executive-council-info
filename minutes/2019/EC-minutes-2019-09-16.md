### Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting September 16, 2019

**19/54 Review of [note taking procedure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/195omPpTOAnwNsUCqbH6S7Wpt9WDqU5joQKGMofTYDmg/edit#), including [addition of non-verbal updates](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/72)**



- The Meeting Conduct document has been updated to include more details of what to include/not include in the notes and what should be done by the note-taker and secretary. Please review the updated document.
- There is also an issue on non-verbal updates and the need to include these in the minutes. These were added in the middle of the year this year and we did not have an explicit statement about including these in the minutes. They should be included.
- We should default to not include details on finances in the public minutes, but it's hard to set hard and fast rules about what constitutes sensitive information. The secretary can always check in with the Chair or Executive Director about what should be shared.

**19/55 [In-person meeting logistics](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/74)**

- Meeting date and location are now set

- ASAP do the two things in the issue: 

    1)  fill in form to help determine the meeting agenda, and 
    2) talk to Talisha about your travel arrangements. Detailed travel info is in the document linked to from the issue

  

**19/56 [Values](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/20) project update and encouraging participation**



- Tracy sent an update via email to the Executive Council yesterday
- The task force is now asking the third question and would like us to offer our feedback and connect with others in our communities to get that feedback from them as well
- No explicit deadline yet, but 2-3 weeks

**19/57 Update on [Incidents Outside CoC Task Force](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/2019/2019-07-incidents-outside-cocc.md)**



- This task force has wrapped up all their meetings and draft report is in place. Cleaned up version will be available to task force today.
- They plan to get this to the Executive Council to see (review and approval not required) before the blog post goes out this Thursday, though deadlines are tight. The Executive Council(EC) will likely get it earlier the day it is posted.

**19/58 Discussion of potential candidates for[ EC-elected Council positions](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/73)**



- We should be looking to avoid automatic standing of current members. It's better to assume people will not continue and require an explicit opt-in to be considered for another term.
- Please add names to the form: [Council-elected EC positions form](https://docs.google.com/a/stanford.edu/forms/d/1-BNo8NMS-EVqGiD5oI6J5sUedkJNKAPwhtLv329srHk/edit?usp=drive_web)
- Tracy had several suggestions that she will contribute via the form
- All - please note if you are willing to contact the people you suggest in the form. Otherwise, Amy and Tracy will divide up that task.
- We can contact more people than we need (which is two), as we are asking them if they are willing to stand for election by us.
- We need to discuss the candidates before we vote, and plan to have the list available for public comment before we need to vote on them.
- Tracy will work with Kate on those details
- Deadline for completion is our next meeting on October 21, 2019

**19/59 [Vision](https://github.com/carpentries-ec/conversations_ec_ed/issues/70) discussion**



- Next iteration of the vision has been posted to the issue with additional contextual information
- We need to get a final decision about the vision made
- It's not the inspiring kind of statement that people were wanting, but it's more important at this point to have something accurate and that describes who we are and where we're going. Trying to make the vision into a slogan is not working.
- Because of the history of the organizations and the newness of the larger organization, the mission and vision may be revisited sooner than might normally happen in an organization. But we need the vision to allow us to do strategic planning.
- One possible hesitation is the word "research" as a lot of our community thinks more broadly than that. Does the vision need to provide this scope, or can that be restricted to the mission and/or the strategic plan?
- Suggestion to include a word like "leading" or "largest" to add a little more inspiration.
- Based on the sponsorship task force, it helps to have a solid, clear idea on what we're doing.
- A proposal was made to vote on statement based on what is in the issue, including a yes/no vote on the vision statement, with/without "research", and with/without superlative.
- Is the vision of this Executive Council around research or is the vision of this Executive Council larger?
- Consider why Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry were started -- to make research better. 
- We aren't very well organized yet around the research scope, so we may need to get that in order before we consider a broader scope. 
- We are circling around a conservative vision; taking out "research" would be a bolder vision. We can take out this term and limit current activities via our strategic plan. 
- Does the community see us expanding beyond research? Yes, we hear this from the community and from the staff as well.
- We could make the vision broader (remove "research"), but focus on research as part of a strategic plan over the next 5 years or so.
- Some communities have some sensitivity around the term "research"; it can have a negative connotation, particularly those groups that have been traditionally the subject of research. Removing the term could help us reach more communities.
- If we remove "research" we are left with "computing" -- is that the right word? For some this term has the connotation of being equated with mathematics.
- It was noted that we spent a lot of time last year at our in-person meeting trying to come up with another way to express the "research computing and data skills" and never found anything, so we should not get too bogged down in this.
- Final decision is to vote as indicated above on the options in the issue.
