# executive-council-info

This repository contains documentation on processes and meetings for the Carpentries Executive Council (EC). 

[The Carpentries Bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#executive-council), 
found in The Carpentries Handbook, describe the composition and main responsibilities of the EC. Current and past members, including which members are officers, can be found in the [Governance section](http://static.carpentries.org/governance/) of the Carpentries website.

Documentation is organized as follows:
* `EC_process`: information about onboarding/offboarding new EC members, yearly tasks/timeline, and specific details of how responsibilities for members and officers are implemented
* `code-of-conduct-transparency-reports`: public releases describing incidents reported to the Code of Conduct Committee
* ` minutes`: formally approved minutes from monthly EC meetings
