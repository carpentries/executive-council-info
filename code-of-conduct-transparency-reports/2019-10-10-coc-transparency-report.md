# The Carpentries Code of Conduct Transparency Report

2019 October 10th
## Overview

### Reports
Between 2019-07-09 and 2019-10-10, the Code of Conduct committee has not received any formal incident reports. 
However, the Incident form was filled out once, with information about an incident that was outside of the scope
of the Carpentries Code of Conduct. 

### Potential Code of Conduct Breaches
The committee has not investigated any Code of Conduct breaches in the last three months. 
However, discussions in the community and within the Code of Conduct committee led 
the Executive Council to approve a relevant task force. This taskforce handed in their 
recommendations on the 19th of September.

### Summary of Police Matters
