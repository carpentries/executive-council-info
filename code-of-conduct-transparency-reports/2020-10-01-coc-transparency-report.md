# The Carpentries Code of Conduct Transparency Report

2020-10-01

## Overview

### Reports

Between 2020-07-01 and 2020-09-30, the Code of Conduct committee processed one formal incident report. 

### Potential Code of Conduct Breaches

There was one report of an incident where a post-workshop survey was flagged to us with the following comment:
> "Unverified email addresses lead to a known stalker registering as a participant and attending the first half of the workshop."

- The report was acknowledged, however it was pointed out by CoC members that it was not reported if the unknown person who was referred to as a stalker had done anything to breach the CoC or disrupt the classroom. Since, that was not the case, this incident was flagged as a Zoom security-related issue, which should not fall into CoC purview. 
- The report was transferred to the Workshop Administrators, with the description that Zoom-bombing/stalking can be avoided by setting the registration controlled access to the Zoom room. 
- To follow up on this from a security perspective, the Quality Assurance Manager informed the reporter that -- our events are all intentionally open as we do not want to create barriers to participation.  For the event mentioned below, we do not know if this event was hosted in a Carpentries Zoom room or by the host institution. If it was the host's own Zoom account, then it is their responsibility to set up security the way they want.  For our events, we recommend that they create a waiting room so the host can decide who to let in.
- The document explaning Zoom related instructions was further shared to ensure that this incident doesn't repeat: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html#creating-a-waiting-room.
