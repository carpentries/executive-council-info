# Onboarding (and offboarding) of Executive Council Members

The official term of office for new Executive Council (EC) Members is February 1. We ask that new Members attend the regularly scheduled EC meeting in January prior to taking office to learn how meetings operate.

* Permissions and access to the following resources should be modified in late December or early January:
  * Google Drive
  * GitHub (organization, teams)
  * Listserv
  * EC Google Calendar
* The Carpentries' website includes [EC Members](http://static.carpentries.org/governance/) and should be updated
