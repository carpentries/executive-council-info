## Transfer of member responsibilities 

New members are announced in late December/early January, at which point they will receive access and permission to the resources listed below. 

The official term of office for new Executive Council (EC) members is February 1. We ask that new members attend the regularly scheduled EC meeting in January prior to taking office to learn how meetings operate, and to prepare for formal transfer of responsibility in February. 

The following EC roles should be assigned at the February meeting:
* Chair
* Vice Chair
* Secretary
* Treasurer
* 2 x 2 Committee representatives
* CoC representative

## Permissions, access, and record keeping
