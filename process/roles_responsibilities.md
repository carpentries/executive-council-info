# Executive Council Roles and Responsibilities

The Carpentries Executive Council is the highest leadership body of The Carpentries. It is responsible for strategic and 
organizational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying 
revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The 
Carpentries public image. Members of the Council also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organization, leveraging 
their networks to benefit the organization’s reputation and fundraising. The Executive Council executes these responsibilities 
through a combination of monthly Executive Council meetings and regular correspondence and collaboration via email and online 
platforms.

## Responsibilities of all Executive Council Members

The Carpentries Executive Council (EC) is an activist Council, which means that Council members are expected to volunteer 
their time to participate actively in the Carpentries community in addition to their duties as EC members, and to be dedicated 
to the Carpentries organization as a whole. The 
[Carpentries Bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#executive-council) describe the formal 
responsibilities of the EC from an 
organizational level. This document describes the current implementation of the tasks described in the bylaws and represents 
flexible guidelines that may be adapted as the EC deems necessary. In addition to documenting EC standard operating 
procedures, it is also intended to clarify EC function for the broader community and help potential members understand the 
commitment to serve on the EC.

In practice, each EC member is responsible for the following general tasks:
* Supporting the Mission and Vision of The Carpentries
* Exemplifying the Code of Conduct
* Ensuring The Carpentries’ adherence to legal agreements and standards
* Offering their expertise to help ensure the health and success of the organization
* Actively participating in discussions about strategic and financial decisions
* Providing feedback and voting on formal motions within one week of their posting
* Attending (in person or by phone) at least 75% of the meetings held each year
* Dedicating at least three volunteer hours per week toward Carpentries activities (including meeting attendance)

The specific commitments expected of EC members include monthly meetings (1-1.5 hours, via Zoom) and a once-yearly 
face-to-face meeting (expenses covered by The Carpentries). Minutes for these meetings are published to this repository after 
approval by EC members. We may periodically schedule additional virtual meetings to address particular topics. Officers and EC 
liaisons to other subcommittees may have additional commitments for meetings. Asynchronous commitments involve suggesting 
agenda items for meetings, responding to email requests for opinions, and formal voting on resolutions (as issues in this 
repository).
